= Providing multiple inventories

AnsibleEE runner is capable of accepting and combining multiple inventory sources
including files and scripts.

Openstack-AnsibleEE-operator allows for provision of multiple inventories through
the `extraMounts` field. Any file mounted, directly or indirecly, under the `/runner/inventory/` path
will be used to create a combinded inventory for the job.

Further information about AnsibleEE inventory processing is provided by https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/runner/en/latest/intro/#inventory[core AnsibleEE docs].
